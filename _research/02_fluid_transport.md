- Investigated the fluid distribution in the nanoporous media using in-house GCMC Fortran code.
- Simulated flow of compressible and incompressible fluids in nanoporous media using the molecular dynamics simulation software LAMMPS and NAMD.
- Developed in-house C codes to analyze the fluid dynamics.
- Calibrated the validation of the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation to fluid transportation in nano-porous.
- Quantified the fluid flux deviation from a theoretical value using a user-friendly parameter (slip length) for numerical simulation.
- Meaningful step in understanding fluid distribution and transport in nano-scale media with wide application in nano-techniques.
