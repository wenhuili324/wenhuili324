*The University of Tokyo, Master Program*

- Polymer synthesis and polymer blend preparation.
- Characterized the polymer using NMR (solution, and solid-state), MALS, GPC, IR, Rheology, TGA, and DSC, etc.
- Analyze and study the relationship between relaxation time and healing properties of the polymer by developing in-house MATLAB code. 
- Stiff, amorphous, transparent, and self-healable supramolecular polymers tailored by high dense H-bonds are discovered. 
- Yongâ€™s modulus is 50 times higher than existing intrinsic self-healing materials.
- Proposed and designed a new polymer blend that is not only reparable but also retains high mechanical robustness under high humidity. 
- Very promising material with far-reaching applications in cabin window and electric products screen etc. with extended lifetime.
