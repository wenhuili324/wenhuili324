Pioneered a novel approach centered around anti-reductive electrolyte wrapping, offering a promising strategy for safeguarding intrinsic electrode materials.   

- Calibrated the important thermodynamics properties of different solvents using polarizable FF.
- Developed C and Fortran codes to analyze complex molecular arrangements of electrolytes in bulk and at electrode interfaces.
- Collaborated with experimental groups, providing theoretical explanations for the working mechanisms of electrolyte design in high-performance Li-battery systems, increasing life span by 10 times.
- Published 1 paper in “Angew. Chem” as equally contributed first co-author, with one more under preparation.
- A cornerstone of renewable and clean energy usage toward carbon net-zero society.
