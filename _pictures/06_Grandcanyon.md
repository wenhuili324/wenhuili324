In the Grand Canyon, there is a trail called the "Trail of Time." As you walk along it, each meter you cover represents 1 million years of geological history, allowing you to witness the nearly 2 billion years of interaction between rock, wind, water, and heat. Interestingly, I am working on interactions at the nanosecond scale. 


The second picture shows Monument Valley in Utah. Cooling and internal stress will shape the base into cubic-like rock formations. Over the next billion years, these striking rocks will eventually turn into sand?
